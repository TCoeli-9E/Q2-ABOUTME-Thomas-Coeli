				<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
				<p>HeLloooo :D im Thomas, I like studying fish and human biology as my passion in life is the study of biology as it is one of the only concepts that truly interest me. ever since I was young ive always been interested with life and the study of the life on earth :D ichthyology has always been my favorite as ive been endeared with fish and aquarium ever since I was young but alas the field lacks funding and resources as well as pay if you work in the field. my favorite food is the chicken fingers from chili's and my favorite fruits are cucumber and mango. my favorite game currently is tiny glade which is very relaxing :) it is one of my artistic outlets and it helps my creativity flourish.</p>
